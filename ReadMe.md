## Results from learning the faculty data

The following are figures representing the learning process for the faculty data.
The legend in each figure represents the number of hyperparameters that were used in generating the learning run.
You will notice the bug that variance estimates go off to inifinity over time.
Perhaps a bug. Or perhaps a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics????
